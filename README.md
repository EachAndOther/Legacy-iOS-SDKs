Legacy iOS SDK's
=================

Apple currently only ship the latest SDK's with Xcode, including updates to Xcode. 

This can make updating legacy apps difficult.

So here's a collection of the SDK's obtained from the Xcode installation DMG's.

Currently available:
 - iOS 4.3 (Not recommended as it's very old)
 - iOS 5.1
 - iOS 6.1

To use these SDKs, drop each of the .sdk folders you need into:
 /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/

Restart XCode and you should be good to go.
